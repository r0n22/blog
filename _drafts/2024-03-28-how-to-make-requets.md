# How to make a request

When you are managing people or asking for something you need to give the person you are giving the request the information they need to make sure that they are doing the right thing in the right amount of time.

The 4 required for a good request:

1. Outcome
2. Context
3. Timeframe
4. Due Date

## Outcome

When you are requesting for something it is better to ask for what you want at the end, for example if you want a report written give a heading outline or an example which can be based off.  People want autoomy to do things the way they want,  when you are asking for help there is an amount of control that you give up.  The final product might not look exactly like what you would have done but that is okay.

## Context

If you are providing someone to do a task they need to be giving the information to do it.  This could be previous attempts at the same thing or the codebase which they are working on.  This makes sure thay they are not doing the same things again for the project.  

## Timeframe

As Parkinson law the work fills the time.  So if you are expecting a couple hour project but you do not communicate that it might balloon into a 5 day project.  In my consulting work I always provide a time box of what I estimate the task should take.  If they are coming up to the the end of the timebox we discuss what has happend and how much more time would be required and determine if that is appropirate.

## Due Date

If you need the task done by a certian date then let the person know.  Make sure that you provide yourself with buffer time between when they give it to you and when you required it to make sure that there is time to check the work and make any tweaks required.  If no due date is given many people will expect this to either be the two extremes highest or lowest priority.  This might not be the correct information and this can cause issues with other project timlines or missed deadlines.

## Example request.

Hi <Name>, can you please help me finish <Task> in <Project A>.  You can find the all of the information about <Project A> in our shared drive.  <Task> is very simliar to the one you did for <Project X> so you can use that as a refrence.  Please have this done by <Due Date> and it should be around <Timeframe>.  Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions.

## Observations

* Mental load managing the task with questions
* Changes or revisions
* Communication channels
