## Working

Soemtimes work can feel all encompasing.  It can be what you think about when you first wake up and the last thing you think about when you go to sleep.  All the current talk is about work life balance.   Making sure that you are able to get to clock out and not think about it anymore.  

My phlisopy is that there are work seasons.  In many businesses are ciycical.  You have busy periods and less busy periods.  I think that making time to relex is important.  Spending time with family. Do something you want to do.  

It is important for communication with the family to know that there is going to be late nights or early mornings.  Set ground rules for whar you are willing to give up and what is important for you.  I will always be home for my daugters bedtime.  

## What to do

The saying "Make hay when the sun shines" is apt, make your revenue when it is avaiable.  Take your breaks when there are slow times in your business.  If you don't have slow times then make sure that you have enough capacity to give a yourself time off.
