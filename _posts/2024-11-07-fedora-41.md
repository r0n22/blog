# Fedora 41 Crashing

I updated the to the latest fedora from the update center to the latest version of Fedora 41.  Everything when great until I went to restart the system.  I was greated with a kernel panic with the following error.

`Refusing to run under cgroup v1, SY# specified on kernel command line`

I am pretty sure  that the cgroup change was required by docker at some point.

Looking around this seems to be that a command line arguments added `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0` to the boot command. 

To get into my computer I had to edit the GRUB command to remove the above arugment then pressed F10 to boot up the system.

we can use `gubby` a command to update all the kernels to remove the argument. 

`grubby --remove-args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy" --update-kernel=ALL`

So this removes the argument `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy` for all kernels on your computer.
