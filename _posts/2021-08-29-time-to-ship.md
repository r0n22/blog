I have been meaning to write a blog post for two months now.  It has been looming on my calendar, overdue.  Always nagging me that I did not get it done.  Why not? I have started 3 blog templates (in different languages). Written half a dozen articles but none are published. Why?

**Perfection**  I finished watching a GDC conference talk by  [Jeff Vogel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs) and I think that he sums it up very nicely.

Blogging has been something that is on my mind for a long time.   I am do not boast or do much bragging about my accomplishments and during my work transitions this has been a hindrance.

As well writing is something that I feel will make myself a better coder and entrepreneur as I move forward.  You can make the greatest product but if no one knows about you you will fail.  I have a couple projects on the go which require marketing but have been too much of a perfectionist to actually hit publish on my landing pages or email campaigns.

This is a change for me.  I will read this over and then ship it.   Everything can always be better.  I could edit this more, could develop a better tagline or put some more links into it.  But you have to be embarrassed about your final product because that means you care about it and you want it to be better then it currently is.

Some times you just have to put it out into the world and get feedback.

So drop me a line and let me know what you think?  What could I have done better? What did I get right? Does this ring true to you as well?
